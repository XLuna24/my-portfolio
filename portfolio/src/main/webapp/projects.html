              <h1>Kalix the Kat</h1>
          <p>Kalix was a character created originally for a platform game called Kat Lives.
              later the project was abandoned although the character returned as a three dimensional
              character for youtube. With motion tracking from an android phone for the facial features
              and an xbox kinect v2. for the body tracking. for now the project is on hold.

              <h1>Project Azul</h1>
          <p>Virtual Reality is fascinating as you can be inside of a game instead of just seeing 
              through a screen. The usual vr headset and controller helps you dive into these vast worlds.
              The problem is many people get sick playing in these games as when they run in these games 
              their body feels as if its moving although its not. With treadmills it help and helps with the immersion.
              treadmills cost a lot for the average consumer and cheap alternative wich is cybershoes does not
              give you full leg movement. Thats where Project Azul comes in. Its a type of treadmill shoe that lets you walk
              in any direction and give the user full body tracking in game.
